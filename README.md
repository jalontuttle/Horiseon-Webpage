# Horiseon-Webpage
## Description
- The motivation behind this project was to create a website that is visually appealing and usable for consumers.
- I built this project to Make sure that customers have an easy effective way to navigate the product and services offered by Horiseon.
- This solved the issues of broken links, and broken semantics.
- I learned how to effectively use HTML and CSS semantics such as Header, Footer, and Section to add priority to sections of the page and style them correctly.
